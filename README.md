# modeling-production-capability
 This exercise involves analyzing production data from various factories across multiple cities. The goal is to develop a model that can probabilistically predict future production amounts. The given data is for two factories: Brussels (BRU) and Stockholm (STO)

 # Folder structure 
 ## data folder
  In the daily-production folder we have two directories with JSON data from both factories which we will use as input for our analysis. 

 ## output
  I created an ouput folder which writes the excel files with the various data we want to output
